## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
df_stock <- read.csv('C:\\Users\\himanshu\\Desktop\\Machine Learning for problem solving\\prices.csv',header = TRUE)
df_dj <- read.csv('C:\\Users\\himanshu\\Desktop\\Machine Learning for problem solving\\dj_index.csv')
```

```{r}
library(reshape2)
library(caret)
```
1.1 Construct a T × N price matrix from the data, where N = 24 is the number of series and T is the
total number of time ticks (days).
```{r}
price_mat <- acast(df_stock, Date~Stock, value.var = "Close")
```
1.2 Standardize the matrix so that each column has mean zero and standard deviation one. Explain why
we should do standardization before applying PCA.
1.3 Apply PCA on the price matrix, and plot the projection of the data on the first principal component.
```{r}
stnd_price_mat <- scale(price_mat)
apply(stnd_price_mat,2,mean)
apply(stnd_price_mat,2,sd)

pca_mat <- prcomp(stnd_price_mat)
pca <- as.data.frame(pca_mat$x)
pca_date <- as.Date(row.names(pca))
ggplot(pca, aes(x=pca_date, y = PC1)) + geom_point()
```

1.4 Next we will compare this principal temporal trend obtained in the previous step with the Dow Jones
Index. Scale both series (zero mean and unit standard deviation) and visualize them as individual
curves in a single plot for comparison
```{r}
df_dj$close_scale <-scale(df_dj$Close)

date_dj <- as.Date(df_dj$Date)


ggplot() + 
  geom_line(data = df_dj,aes(x=date_dj,y = df_dj$close_scale, colour = "green")) + 
  geom_line(data = pca,aes(x= pca_date,y = pca$PC1, colour = "red"))
```

These two time series are comparable and can be used for time series analysis. The PCA transformed series capture majority of variance and explains it well.



Reconstruct price history for each stock based on the top 10 principal components

Calculate the reconstruction error (the difference of reconstructed value and original value) for each
stock on each time tick. Use the L2 norm of the error series for each stock as its anomalousness score
and give the names of the top 3 "anomalous" stocks.
```{r}
recon <- as.matrix(pca_mat$x[,1:10]) %*% t(as.matrix(pca_mat$rotation[,1:10]))

recon_df <- as.data.frame(recon)

df_price <- as.data.frame(price_mat)

error <- df_price -recon_df
head(error)
anomalus<- apply(error,2, norm_vec <- function(x) sqrt(sum(x^2)))

error_norm <- as.data.frame(anomalus)
error_norm$stock <- rownames(error_norm)
row.names(error_norm)<- NULL
error_norm_order <- error_norm[order(-anomalus), ]
head(error_norm_order,3)


```


Plot the reconstructed price history and the original history for the most anomalous stock
```{r}
df_price <- as.data.frame(price_mat)
price_date <- as.Date(rownames(df_price))
recon_date <- as.Date(rownames(recon_df))
ggplot() + 
  geom_line(data = df_price,aes(x=price_date,y = df_price$KSS, colour = "green")) + 
  geom_line(data = pca,aes(x= recon_date,y = recon_df$KSS, colour = "red"))
```

```{r}

```
